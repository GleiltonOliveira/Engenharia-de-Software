  "<strong>Those who understand others are intelligent. Those who understand themselves are enlightened . Those who overcome others have strength. Those who overcome themselves are powerful. Those who know contentment are wealthy. Those who proceed vigorously have willpower. Those who do not lose their base endure. Those who die but do not perish have longevity."</strong><br><br> - Lao Tzu
